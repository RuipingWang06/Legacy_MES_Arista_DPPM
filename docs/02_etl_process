Consumed qty
- Retrieve all Serial Numbers (SNs) from the previous day.
- Use a cursor to iterate through each SN.
- For each SN, execute the **Purge data** query to fetch related data. sql/reference/up_CT_ListCRDsBySerialNumberByCustomer.sql .
- Insert the query results into a temporary table within the loop.
- After all data is collected, aggregate the **consumed quantity** by:
  - Supplier  
  - MPN (Manufacturer Part Number)  
  - Material

failed qty
- Review the user's query conditions used when calling the API.
- Analyze the API's internal SQL to understand the default filter conditions.
- Identify the gap between the default logic and the user's requirement.
- Refine the logic to only return **FailedQty** records where **replacement occurred**.
